This python project shows use of Object Oriented Programming OOP to create the viral snake game.
Various classes were used but most abundantly the Turtle class was used throughout this project.
I also made my own classes using class inheritence from turtle which you would need to use in order to run this project.
The main code is in the main.py file and the classes i made are every other file in this repository.
The arrow keys are used to control the direction of the snake and the snakes tail increases in lengt every time the snake head collides with food.
Collisions with the wall and tail are detected and will end the geame.
The game run is shown below:
